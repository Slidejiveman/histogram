# histogram
Histogram project that accepts user input.

By Ryder Dale Walton Solves problem 5.1 from Introduction to Parallel Programming by Peter Pacheco

The solution works. I did not do extensive robustness testing, so there are no issues that I am aware of outside of the obvious. 
Some obvious issues include:
I did not add extensive error checking on the input, so I know if the user inputs negative values, the program should error out.

Additionally, I'd like to try and add more intelligent parallelization to the program. What I've added produces consistently correct
results, but that doesn't mean that it couldn't be significantly better.

I tested in a Windows 10 environment using CLion.
